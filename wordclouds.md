## Comparing word/data sets:

- Experimental Comparison of Semantic Word Clouds. Lukas Barth, Stephen G. Kobourov, Sergey Pupyrev. https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/~kobourov/wordle2.pdf
- Upset: Interactive set visualization for more than three sets https://jku-vds-lab.at/tools/upset/ 
 Venn diagrams are a horrible way to visualize intersections of more than three or four sets. The figure below shows an example of a six-set venn diagram published in Nature that shows the relationship between the bananaâ€™s genome and the genome of five other species.

 Now see it using UpSet:
