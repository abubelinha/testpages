## Comparing word/data sets:

- Upset: Interactive set visualization for more than three sets https://jku-vds-lab.at/tools/upset/ 
 Venn diagrams are a horrible way to visualize intersections of more than three or four sets. The figure below shows an example of a six-set venn diagram published in Nature that shows the relationship between the bananaâ€™s genome and the genome of five other species.

 Now see it using UpSet:

```Python
set1 = {1, 2}
set2 = {1, 3}
set3 = {1, 4}

intersection = set.intersection(set1, set2, set3)
# Find intersection of the three sets


print(intersection)
# OUTPUT:
# {1}
```
